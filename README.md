# Project purpose 🎯

This visualizer is a web-based tool that's not intended to be useful, it's just for fun !

However, this project is carried out in a school setting, and is carried out under certain criteria: 

- Make a responsive website
- Make a website with an original functionality (which can be found on this [website](https://whatwebcando.today/)
- To do something creative

# Usage 🧰

To use the tool, you will need to authorise access to your camera, and also turn up the volume just a little 😄 and then that's it.
